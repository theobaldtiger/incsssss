			<h3> A heartly welcome to the <span class="network_blue">Critical Information Network</span></h3>
			<p>
				Thinking about our world today makes me feel sorrowful. I don't want to live in a society anymore in which theoretically all people are free in their decisions, but practically are not. Our governments shall represent our interests, but I claim to say that they are not doing so. I don't want to live in a world of economic competition, but in a world of cooperation, where people help each other, instead of trying to outcompete each other. I want to live in a world in which everyone has the same possibilities, regardless of their place of birth or nationality, or sociocultural aspects, such as the education of parents. I want to live in a society that is open and tolerant. A society that is able to understand which decisions are made and which consequences they have. I want a society that has time to enjoy life instead of working more and more. I want people to make a conscious decision on their life and consumption habits. I want to live in a world that strives for social progress, not for economic progress. I want to live in a world in which people see each other as humans, not as citizens of different nations.

				Admittedly, this vision is far from reality. Mostly, I claim, because people lack effective access to critical information sources. Many people already work on analyzing existing problems in a critical and distanced manner. Also, some people have started to develop and practise alternatives to the established ways of doing things. However, using the established ways of informing oneself (newspapers, search-engines, television) makes it almost impossible to find these sources. Therefore, this website is intended to bridge this gap by giving every citizen access to a variety of critical information. Start having a look into our <a href="topics_index.html">topics</a>, where we have described certain important political issues that might be often hard to understand when only having a small amount of time for informing oneself a day. Also, you are free to browse through the <a href="videos_index.html">videos</a> and <a href="literature_index.html">literature</a> independently from the topics.
